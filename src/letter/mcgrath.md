To whom it may concern,

I wholeheartedly endorse SSG McGrath.  As an anti-tank platoon leader,
I led the forward logistics element while deployed under SOTF-East.
Our mission was to resupply ODAs based in Paktika and Paktia province.
Our platoon was also embedded with ODAs for clearing missions and base
defense operations.  After the deployment, I served as a rifle platoon
leader, company executive officer and the battalion S4 OIC.

SSG McGrath joined our platoon as a platoon sergeant in October 2011.
He quickly started improving the platoon by focusing on infantry
tasks, medical training and physical fitness.  SSG McGrath built
workouts for the platoon by blending the best parts from Military
Athlete and his own personal experience.  At each village stability
platform (VSP) we resupplied, SSG McGrath supervised the transfer of
supplies and worked closely with the team sergeant and engineer
sergeant to ensure the team had the supplies required for their
mission.  His close coordination allowed us to work directly with the
ODAs when their missions required additional personnel.  In December
2011, our platoon partnered with ODA 3326 at VSP Chamkani to provide
additional security in response to a Taliban raid on the village
center.  SSG McGrath’s focus on the fundamentals paid dividends as our
platoon reacted calmly and swiftly to exceptional situations.  After
an RPG detonated in the midst of the Afghan Local Police, 12 Afghan
casualties were rushed to VSP Chamkani.  SSG McGrath immediately
initiated the mass casualty plan.  He placed security, ensured the HLZ
was clear and then assisted the medical sergeant with the most
critical casualties.  His calm, collected demeanor set the tone for
those around him and helped save multiple lives that day.

SSG McGrath’s mastery of infantry tasks and innate ability to relate
to and teach his subordinates is unparalleled.  His calm awareness
under pressure will provide a valuable asset for any organization.
