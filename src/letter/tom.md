Dear General Caslen,

I would like to share a few words about Tom Schafer, my brother and
friend.  As his brother, I've had the unique opportunity to watch Tom
transition from sibling rivalry into a military officer.

I commissioned from West Point in 2010 as an Infantryman.  I graduated
from Ranger School in 2011, following in the footsteps of my
grandfather, Ranger class of 1954, and my father, an honor graduate
for the Ranger class of 1992.  I then joined the 1-505th Parachute
Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division and deployed as a heavy
weapons platoon leader.  During my time in 1-505PIR, I also served as
rifle platoon leader, company executive officer, battalion S4 OIC and
earned my senior parachutist badge.

Tom and I competed in everything imaginable during our childhood.  As
the oldest sibling, I'm simultaneously disappointed and excited when
one of my younger siblings challenges and bests me.  I joined the
high-school track team and ran long distance events.  Naturally, Tom
joined both the cross country team and the track team.  I ran the mile
in 5:15; Tom ran the mile in 4:24.  I played ultimate Frisbee as an
intramural and won our regimental championship; Tom played on the West
Point club ultimate Frisbee team and won a regional tournament at
West Point.  I placed first in our battalion's 12 mile Expert
Infantryman Badge ruck march.  Well, Tom hasn't bested my ruck march
record, but I fear it's only a matter of time.

The same drive and motivation inherent in the our family courses
through Tom's veins.  He possesses the hallmarks of future Airborne
Ranger, moving further, faster and fighting harder at every turn.  I
ask that you allow Tom to show the Army the elite Soldier he is and
always has been.
