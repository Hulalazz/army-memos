1. I would like to share a few words about Tom Schafer, my brother and
   friend.  As his brother, I've had the unique opportunity to watch
   Tom transistion from our sibling rivalry into a military Officer

2. I graduated from West Point in 2010 as an Infantryman.  I gratuated
   from Ranger School in 2010, following in the footsteps of my
   Grandfater (Ranger class of 1954) and my father (the honor graduate
   for the Ranger class of 1993).  I joined the 1-505st Parachute
   Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division and deployed as a heavy
   weapons platoon leader.  During my time in 1-505PIR, I also served
   as rifle platoon leader, company executive officer and the
   battalion S4 OIC.  I currently attend the Maneuver Captains Career
   Course.

3. Tom and I competed in everything imaginable during our childhood.
   As the oldest sibling, I'm simulataneously disappointed and awed
   when one of my younger siblings bests me.  I joined the track team
   and ran long distance.  Naturally, Tom joined the cross country
   team and the track team.  I ran the mile in 5:15; Tom ran the mile
   in ???.  I played ultimate frisbee as an intramural and won
   regimental championshiop; Tom helped establish the West Point club
   ultimate frisbee team and played across the country.  I placed
   first in our battalion's 12 mile Expert Infantryman's Badge ruck
   march.  Well, Tom hasn't topped me yet, but I fear it's only a
   matter of time.

4. The same drive and motivation inherent in our family courses
   through Tom's veins.  He possesses the hallmarks of fine Airborne
   Ranger, moving further, faster and fighting harder at every turn.
   I ask that you allow Tom to show the Army the elite Soldier he is
   and always has been.
